# Overview

I really want to be apart of the ag techonology industry. I want to learn how build and plan software. I want to be apart of the transition into precision ag. For this reason i wanted to build an app. 

This app is meant to calculate the days horses can stay on feed. It is written in react native so it can be used for both ios and android. 

I want to create an app after school. I really think that i can build this and sell it. I wanted to get it started now and get through the process to learn how to build an app. 

I couldnt link the videos. The first is the code. The second is the app running on my phone.
